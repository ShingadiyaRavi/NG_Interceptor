Task - 13
Interceptor :
	
	This is used for the get data from the api and manage the response and if authentic user can get data otherwise not.

	it means it is a middlware between request and response.
	
	it is always run when we used http requests.

	if we have more than one Interceptor then we check all Interceptor is without error because of any Interceptor generate the error then all Interceptor not work.

	create using :
		cmd : ng generate interceptor interceptorName
	
	so care about that...

	How to work :
	request send to server but first request go in Interceptor and it will give to server
	then server give response but that response come in the Interceptor
	then Interceptor give a response to request....
